Proposal!

I plan to make it a POV video of the viewer being a girl at a Mexican dance (a Baile). 
You're talking to another girl who is also sitting out the Nortenas.
You are then taken out to dance once El Payaso del Rodeo (a popular line dance) comes on. 

I want to use a party based background for the green screen, and I will be overlaying two
songs into the video. I will be using Capcut as my video editor.
